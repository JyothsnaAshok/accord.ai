# accord.ai

## Inspiration
We’ve all experienced the hassle of managing agreements—digging through emails, deciphering legal jargon, and coordinating reviews. A friend shared how a he lost some money due to missed clause in an agreement. This sparked an idea: what if there was a smarter, faster way to handle agreements that minimized human error and freed up time for what really matters? That’s how Accord.ai was born.

## What it does
Accord.ai takes the headache out of managing agreements. It uses AI to analyze uploaded agreements, providing actionable insights like key clauses, risks, and deadlines. Users can assign reviewers, track progress, and ensure compliance seamlessly. Think of it as your smart assistant that turns legal chaos into clarity—effortlessly.

## Key Features:
AI Insight Generation: Automatically generates key insights from contracts for faster decision-making.
Reviewer Management: Easily add or remove reviewers for collaborative review.
Compliance Monitoring: Continuously ensures compliance with legal standards.
Signing Capabilities: Integrated e-signing functionality to streamline the contract execution process.
Notifications: Automated email alerts to keep users updated on document status and actions.

## How we built it
We started with a robust AI engine trained on a wide variety of legal documents, fine-tuning it to identify patterns and extract meaningful insights. The frontend is built with Next.js and powered by Supabase for secure file storage and metadata handling. The backend is build in Nodejs with Gemini models powering our engine. We integrated DocuSign’s embedded signing API to make the review process intuitive and legally binding.

## Challenges we ran into
One big challenge was ensuring the AI could handle the nuances of legal language without oversimplifying. Balancing speed with accuracy was another hurdle. We also spent considerable time fine-tuning user workflows to make the platform powerful yet intuitive. And, of course, integrating multiple APIs while maintaining data security was a constant juggling act.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud that Accord.ai doesn’t just process agreements; it transforms the entire experience. Seeing it save hours for users and improve compliance accuracy has been incredibly rewarding. Successfully implementing features like multi-reviewer workflows and automated risk analysis feels like a big win.

## What we learned
Legal tech is about more than just automation—it’s about trust. Users want a tool they can rely on for sensitive documents. We also learned the importance of user feedback in shaping the product; every tweak we made based on real-world usage significantly improved the platform.

## What's next for Accord.ai
The journey has just begun! Next, we aim to enhance our AI’s capabilities to provide deeper insights, like industry-specific compliance checks. We’re also exploring integrations with other productivity tools and expanding multi-language support. Ultimately, we envision Accord.ai as the go-to platform for smarter, faster agreement management across industries. We also want to integrate our app completely with Docusign to seamless import documents and generate actionable insights out of them.
